        <h2>The Secret to Long Lasting Wealth</h2>
        <p>
            Investers such as the likes of Warren Buffet have been involved with the stock market for decades. The secret to their
            immense wealth has to do with a concept called <strong>compound interest</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's break this concept down for a moment. Let's say you are interested in buying a stock of "Company Y" for $10.00 a share today and you buy
            10 shares of said stock. You now own $100.00 worth of "Company Y" shares. The average annualized return adjusted for inflation of the stock market
            over a 30 year span is roughly 8.3%. Based on this average, after your first year holding these shares, they will now be worth $108.30 assuming you
            did not <strong>"dollar average"</strong> and buy more shares over the course of this first year. Now, instead of earning 8.3% interest on your
            initial $100.00, you will gain 8.3% of $108.30, resulting in your shares of "Company Y" being worth $117.29. As your money continues to grow over time
            for 30 years, suddenly your 10 shares of "Company Y" you purchased for $100.00 are now worth $1195.83. That is a gain of over 1000% on your money!
        </p>

            <h3 class="average">What is Dollar Averaging?</h3>
            <p class="average">
                What happens if we decide to buy more shares of "Company Y" throughout the year after our initial purchase of 10 shares? Let's say we decide that 
                "Company Y" is a strong business and has a bright future ahead of it and should be worth much more than it is now in the future and want to buy more
                shares. We buy 10 more shares at $10.50 a share, resulting in us owning 10 shares at a cost basis of $10.00 a share and 10 shares at a cost basis of
                $10.50 a share. This would result in our cost average of our 20 total shares being $10.25 a share. Why is this important? Well, we have doubled our
                equity within the company. So instead of gaining $0.50 a share ($5.00 total) if the stock goes up $0.50, we gain $10.00 total. Dollar averaging, 
                combined with compound interest, results in capital gains that can help you retire earlier than you could ever have imagined. There are, however, two
                more events that can help us compound our savings even quicker:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dividend Re-investment</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Stock Splits</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Why is it important to gain interest on your capital? The simple answer is <strong>inflation</strong>. The average inflation rate of the U.S. dollar
            per year over the last 30 years has been roughly 2% (conservatively). What this means is for every dollar you have sitting in cash or in a checking
            account becomes worth $0.98 worth of spending power the following year. So if you are not gaining atleast 2% interest on your savings every year, 
            you are actually getting <strong><em>poorer</em></strong> every year even if you do not spend a penny.
