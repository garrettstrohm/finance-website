        <h2>The Secret to Long Lasting Wealth</h2>
        <p>Investers such as the likes of Warren Buffet have been involved with the stock market for decades. The secret to their
            immense wealth has to do with a concept called <strong>compound interest</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's break this concept down for a moment. Let's say you are interested in buying a stock of "Company Y" for $10.00 a share today and you buy
            10 shares of said stock. You now own $100.00 worth of "Company Y" shares. The average annualized return adjusted for inflation of the stock market
            over a 30 year span is roughly 8.3%. Based on this average, after your first year holding these shares, they will now be worth $108.30 assuming you
            did not <strong>"dollar average"</strong> and buy more shares over the course of this first year. Now, instead of earning 8.3% interest on your
            initial $100.00, you will gain 8.3% of $108.30, resulting in your shares of "Company Y" being worth $117.29. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is it important to gain interest on your capital? The simple answer is <strong>inflation</strong>. The average inflation rate of the U.S. dollar
            per year over the last 30 years has been roughly 2% (conservatively). What this means is for every dollar you have sitting in cash or in a checking
            account becomes worth $0.98 worth of spending power the following year. So if you are not gaining atleast 2% interest on your savings every year, 
            you are actually getting <strong><em>poorer</em></strong> every year even if you do not spend a penny.
