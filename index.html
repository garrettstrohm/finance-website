        <h2>The Secret to Long Lasting Wealth</h2>
        <h3>How did Warren Buffet Become So Rich?</h3>
        <p>
            Investers such as the likes of Warren Buffet have been involved with the stock market for decades. The secret to their
            immense wealth has to do with a concept called <strong>compound interest</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's break this concept down for a moment. Let's say you are interested in buying a stock of "Company Y" for $10.00 a share today and you buy
            10 shares of said stock. You now own $100.00 worth of "Company Y" shares. The average annualized return adjusted for inflation of the stock market
            over a 30 year span is roughly 8.3%. Based on this average, after your first year holding these shares, they will now be worth $108.30 assuming you
            did not <strong>"dollar average"</strong> and buy more shares over the course of this first year. Now, instead of earning 8.3% interest on your
            initial $100.00, you will gain 8.3% of $108.30, resulting in your shares of "Company Y" being worth $117.29. As your money continues to grow over time
            for 30 years, suddenly your 10 shares of "Company Y" you purchased for $100.00 are now worth $1195.83. That is a gain of over 1000% on your money!
        </p>

            <h3 class="average">What is Dollar Averaging?</h3>
            <p class="average">
                What happens if we decide to buy more shares of "Company Y" throughout the year after our initial purchase of 10 shares? Let's say we decide that 
                "Company Y" is a strong business and has a bright future ahead of it and should be worth much more than it is now in the future and want to buy more
                shares. We buy 10 more shares at $10.50 a share, resulting in us owning 10 shares at a cost basis of $10.00 a share and 10 shares at a cost basis of
                $10.50 a share. This would result in our cost average of our 20 total shares being $10.25 a share. Why is this important? Well, we have doubled our
                equity within the company. So instead of gaining $0.50 a share ($5.00 total) if the stock goes up $0.50, we gain $10.00 total. Dollar averaging, 
                combined with compound interest, results in capital gains that can help you retire earlier than you could ever have imagined. There are, however, two
                more events that can help us compound our savings even quicker:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dividend Re-investment</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Stock Splits</strong></li>
                </ul>

        <h3>The Importance of Gaining Interest on Your Savings</h3>
        <p>
            Why is it important to gain interest on your capital? The simple answer is <strong>inflation</strong>. The average inflation rate of the U.S. dollar
            per year over the last 30 years has been roughly 2% (conservatively). What this means is for every dollar you have sitting in cash or in a checking
            account becomes worth $0.98 worth of spending power the following year. So if you are not gaining atleast 2% interest on your savings every year, 
            you are actually getting <strong><em>poorer</em></strong> every year even if you do not spend a penny. Check out the compound interest calculator down
            below to see how much compound interest can help you gain over time!

        <h3>Dividend Re-Investments and Stock Splits</h3>
        <p>
            Owning a stock and gaining interest on your shares as the company grows over time is not the only way to get more bang for your buck
            when it comes to your savings. Some companies pay out something known as a "dividend". A dividend is a sum of money paid out regularly 
            to it's shareholders (usually quarterly) out of their profits (or reserves if they had a poorly performing month). That's right, some
            companies will <strong><em>pay you to own their stock</em></strong>. The typical dividend payout of a "dividend" or "blue-chip" stock is
            between 3%-5% with some paying upwards of 8%! Buying dividend granting stocks that may not have as much growth potential in the long run
            is usually a good strategy for those getting ready to retire. For someone younger or in the beginning of their investing journey, dividend
            payments may not necessarily be needed to live off of right away. The perfect solution for someone in this situation is to have their brokerage
            put their stock on a "DRIP" plan. This stands for Dividend Re-investment Program. When you are paid out your dividend of stock X, instead of
            placing the cash in your brokerages cash balance, the brokerage will instead purchase partial/whole shares of the stock equivalent to the
            cash balance of their payout. Remember what was mentioned earlier with dollar averaging? Not only can you be cost-averaging with your own
            contributions, but now the dividend payouts will further help compound your shares and thus compound the worth of your investment.
